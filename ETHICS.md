# Ethical Standard for the TTST Project

## 1. Our Philosophy

The TTST project is developed with the belief that science should deepen mutual understanding among humanity, expand creativity, and contribute to the well-being of society as a whole.

Based on this belief, we hereby establish the ethical standards that everyone involved in this project should respect.

## 2. Ethical Use Request

We strongly request, as a social norm, that all individuals and organizations using the AGPL-licensed version of this project refrain from the following uses:

* **Misuse of Life Manipulation**: Application to synthetic biology without ethical consideration
* **Pseudoscientific Claims**: Use for claims lacking scientific basis
* **Environmental Destruction**: Application intended to harm the Earth's environment
* **Military Purposes**: Direct or indirect use in any military or weapon systems, including lethal autonomous weapon systems (LAWS)
* **Human Rights Oppression**: Use for surveillance, discrimination, invasion of privacy, or any purpose that suppresses or violates internationally recognized human rights
* **Excessive Exploitation**: Use in unfair labor practices, provision of highly addictive services, exploitation based on information disparity, or any commercial/non-commercial activity that undermines human dignity

This request is a **social contract** shared by our project community, independent of the legal terms of the AGPL license. We seek open collaboration with those who agree with these values.

## 3. Legally Binding in Commercial License

The above ethical standards are incorporated as legally binding contractual clauses in the **commercial license** of this project.

Companies obtaining a commercial license must legally agree to comply with these usage restrictions. In case of breach of contract, appropriate measures including license revocation will be taken.

This ensures ethical consistency in commercial activities as well.

## 4. Expectations for Contributors

Contributors to this project are deemed to agree with this ethical standard. We do not accept proposals or implementations of features that violate this standard. Scientific integrity and constructive discussion are expected.
